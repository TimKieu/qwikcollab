1. If A types it should show on B's screen
2. If A marks cursor, it should show on B's screen
3. If A disconnects and B types, the typed word should show on A screen after reconnecting
(why send pending buffer instead of original text on reconnecting ?)
4. If A logs out then it should show on B's screen that A has logged out
